# JavaScript Calculator

> This project was built without following a complete tutorial.  
> Logic was developed incrementally by identifying and fixing bugs.


## Features
- Number & operator input
- Clear (C) button
- Expression evaluation using eval()
- Prevents invalid operator usage

## Core Concepts Practiced

### 1. DOM Manipulation
- Selected and updated HTML elements using `document.querySelector()`
- Controlled the calculator display through JavaScript

### 2. Event Handling
- Handled button clicks using inline `onclick`
- Passed values from HTML to JavaScript functions

### 3. String vs Number Handling
- Built expressions as strings while typing
- Converted string expressions to numeric results on `=` press
- Understood why `+` behaves differently with strings

### 4. Conditional Logic
- Used `if / else if / else` to control calculator behavior
- Differentiated between numbers, operators, clear, and equals actions

### 5. Debugging JavaScript Logic
- Identified and fixed `NaN` issues
- Debugged operator handling errors
- Learned to reason about code behavior step-by-step


## Future improvements
- Remove eval()
- Add decimal support
- Keyboard input
